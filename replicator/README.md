# Replicator

The Replicator comes from Programming by Stealth 131 and is meant as something
to practice doing module documentation. This is the Elixir equivilent to the
JSDocs in that episode.

You can find the episode and show notes at [https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs131]
(https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs131).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `replicator` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:replicator, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/replicator](https://hexdocs.pm/replicator).
